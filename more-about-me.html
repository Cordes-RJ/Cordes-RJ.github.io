  <h1 class="article-title">About Me</h1>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I used to write very regularly but I don’t have as much of a reason to do any non-technical writing lately so this site was mostly just thrown together to articulate my thoughts somewhere linkable to friends. I figured I’d write a small about-me
    section so there’s some idea of who I am if you end up here and don’t already know me.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    My name is R.J. Cordés. I've done a lot of things, but most recently, I was pursuing a triple major in Accounting, 
    Computer Science, and a Cert. in Financial Markets and dropped out to study memory, learning theory/pedagogy, 
    ontology, epistemology and game theory on my own with the goal of
    starting a company that provides alternatives to traditional education as well as solutions 
    to the problems it’s facing. It’s been, and continues to be, an exhausting, yet fulfilling, process.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    Some stuff:
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I'm a member of a Dept. of Defense subcommittee on Universal Learner Records, led by Ashley Reardon, which is conducting a meta-analysis of existing data specs, standards and governance across the DoD and the Private Sector. The goal of the committee is to recommend policy and define a new ULR system suitable for use across the entire DoD.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I'm a member of a Dept. of Defense subcommittee on Identity Management and Cyber Security, led by Yihau Liu, which is conducting an analysis of DoD wide initiatives for identity management. The goal of the committee is to develop a security architecture and requirements for global identity management protocols across multiple systems within the DoD and for Total Learning Architectures (TLA).
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I'm a member of a Dept. of Defense subcommittee on Competency Management, led by Mike Hernandez, which will work with the IEEE to do an analysis of current compentency management portfolio protocols and develop a new, anti-fragile definition for competency objects.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I'm a member of two working groups, the Advanced Distributed Learning Total Learning Architecture working group run by SETA contractors Avron Barr and Brent Smith with the DoD, and the Complexity Science Working Group run by Daniel Friedman PhD. at Stanford University.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">

    Before going to college I ran a company that produced geopolitical and financial research.

  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I've hiked (most of) the appalachian trail. (Section-Hiker, don't judge me)
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I spent the majority of my childhood preparing for West Point Military Academy.
  </p>


  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I spent a reasonable portion of my teen years in and out of hospital for a spinal injury and embracing baggy clothing to hide my back brace. The other half I spent running an informal organization of traders who were using MMORPGs as investment
    vehicles.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I failed high school math because I was busy selling video-game gold to lithuanians, developing trading strategies, and figuring out how to predict market behavior.

  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">

    I was an equity trader for a while, mostly focusing on expectations/predictions of government solicitation orders and DARPA initiatives.

  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    Lived in Warsaw for a while and I have yet to find a new favourite city.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    With a great team and a great advisor, took over our college’s honors organisation when it was 17 people in an abandoned chem room and brought it up to 150 members in a furnished commons/office with access to academic conference.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I’m (slowly) writing a book on education as a national security issue.
  </p>
   <p class="article-paragraph">
    I’m (very slowly) writing a book on relearning formal math as an adult.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    While I mostly do technical writing, I've published some poetry and short stories.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I loved living in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I’m really interested in culture markets and other attempts to codify complex systems with complex participants.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I love training dogs.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I was once almost eaten by a pack of feral dogs.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I like carpentry and built the office I work in.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I've been to 32 countries.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I make up for my lack of a finished degree by spending most of the hours of the day learning and building things, 
    trying to read a book a week (time permitting), and by being lucky enough to have worked under and with individuals who appreciate
    what I bring to the table.
