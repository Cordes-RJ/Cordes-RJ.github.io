  <h1 class="article-title">About Me</h1>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I used to write very regularly but I don’t have as much of a reason to do any non-technical writing lately so this site was mostly just thrown together to articulate my thoughts somewhere linkable to friends. I figured I’d write a small about-me
    section so there’s some idea of who I am if you end up here and don’t already know me.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    My name is R.J. Cordés. I was pursuing a triple major in Accounting, Computer Science, and a Cert. in Financial Markets but dropped out to study memory, learning theory/pedagogy, ontology, epistemology and game theory on my own with the goal of
    starting a company that provides alternatives to traditional education as well as solutions to the problems it’s facing. It’s been, and continues to be, an exhausting, yet fulfilling, process.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    Some stuff:
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">

    Before going to college I ran a company that produced geopolitical and financial research.

  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I spent the majority of my childhood preparing for West Point Military Academy.
  </p>


  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I spent a reasonable portion of my teen years in and out of hospital for a spinal injury and embracing baggy clothing to hide my back brace. The other half I spent running an informal organization of traders who were using MMORPGs as investment
    vehicles.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I failed high school math because I was busy selling video-game gold to lithuanians, developing trading strategies, and figuring out how to predict market behavior.

  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">

    I was an equity trader for a while, mostly focusing on expectations/predictions of government solicitation orders and DARPA initiatives.

  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I lived in Warsaw, Poland for a little while.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    With a great team and a great advisor, took over our college’s honors organisation when it was 17 people in an abandoned chem room and brought it up to 150 members in a furnished commons/office with access to academic conference.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I’m (slowly) writing a book on relearning math as an adult.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I lived in Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a little while.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I’m really interested in culture markets and other attempts to codify complex systems with complex participants.
  </p>
  <p class="article-paragraph">
    I make up for my lack of a finished degree by spending most of the hours of the day learning and building things, trying to read a book a week (time permitting), and by being lucky enough to have worked under and with individuals who appreciate
    what I bring to the table.
